## **BANK / FINANCIAL INSTITUTION**

·       Unsure whether a call is legitimate? Hang up and call back using the number of the company on their publicly listed website or on the back of your Debit / Credit Card (and not the number the caller gives you).

·       Don't be pressured to click a link – **your Bank will never ask you to log on to your bank accounts or provide your personal information via a link in an email or SMS.**

·       **Your Financial Institution will never ask you to transfer money to another account to keep it safe**. It's safe where it is.

·       If you want to ensure your safety - communicate via your app - it's authenticated and protected.

·       Always double-check payment details. Don't be pressured into making a payment. Your money's safe in your account.
